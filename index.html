                    Hello user my name is Jimmy, and I am a college freshman at the time of creating this website.
                    On this site you can play multiple card games, at this current moment online multiplayer doesn't work,
                    but don't worry it's coming as soon as I figure out how to connect to a server. Once I do that I'm
                    going to add more games, the top three on my list of to implement are War, Spades, and Rummy. I will
                    also be planing on opening a part of the website where you can make request. I also plan on including
                    a ranking system.
                </p>
